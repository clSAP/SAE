# SAE
# The Emergency Alert System - SAE - is the service that the government has defined to transmit a message that will be issued in the event of tsunami risks, major earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and forest fires threatening housing.
# We need to create an application (.apk) that configure the emergency channels and that the user can not disable it.
